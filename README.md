# Heart_Attack_prediction
For medical professionals to make well-informed judgments and prompt therapies, 
early cardiovascular disease prediction is essential. By preventing serious illnesses like 
heart failure, heart attacks, stroke, and coronary artery disease, early detection of heart 
disease can improve patient outcomes and lower medical expenses. The goal of this 
work is to use machine learning techniques to create a high-accuracy heart disease 
prediction system.
The core of the proposed system is a Gradient Boosting (GB) model, known for its 
robustness and effectiveness in classification tasks. This model is used to classify 
patients as having heart disease or not, based on various clinical data. To enhance the 
model's performance, a feature selection technique is employed. This technique 
identifies the most informative subset of features, thereby removing noisy and 
redundant data. This not only simplifies the model but also improves its accuracy and 
interpretability.
The experimental setup utilizes open-source clinical datasets, specifically the Kaggle 
heart failure dataset, to train and validate the prediction model. The results from these 
experiments are promising, with the model achieving the highest classification 
accuracy of 95%. This high level of accuracy underscores the model's capability in 
identifying complex patterns and relationships within the clinical data.
By integrating feature selection with the Gradient Boosting model, the system 
effectively handles the intricacies of clinical datasets, ensuring that the predictions are 
both reliable and precise. The success of this approach demonstrates the potential of 
machine learning in transforming heart disease diagnosis, providing a valuable tool for 
medical experts to make well-informed decisions and improve patient care. This study 
highlights the importance of combining advanced algorithms with thoughtful data 
preprocessing to achieve superior predictive performance in the healthcare domain.
