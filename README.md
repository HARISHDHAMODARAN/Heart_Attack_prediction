# Heart_Attack_prediction
This project aims to predict heart disease early using machine learning. A Gradient Boosting (GB) model is employed for robust classification, enhanced with feature selection to remove noisy/redundant data and improve accuracy.

Dataset: Kaggle Heart Failure Dataset

Approach: Gradient Boosting + Feature Selection

Accuracy: Achieved 95% classification accuracy

Impact: Helps in early detection of cardiovascular diseases like heart failure, stroke, and coronary artery disease, enabling better patient care and reduced healthcare costs.

This work demonstrates how combining advanced ML algorithms with smart data preprocessing can deliver reliable and precise predictions in healthcare.
